        To use this dataset, you first need to download the data from dbnomics and
        save it to your local machine, in the following directory:

        {file_path}

        To do this, follow these steps:

        Step 1:
        --------
        Retrieve the data from dbnomics and store it. Example code:

            <ROOT_PACKAGE>.wbWDI.dbDownload().example_code()

        Step 2:
        --------
        After downloading, use the data via:

            <ROOT_PACKAGE>.wbWDI.get(indicator, frequency)

        -> 'indicator' is defined in the documentation of the main series included in
           the dataset. Example:

            documentation = <ROOT_PACKAGE>.wbWDI.dbDownload().main_series_documentation()
            print(documentation)

        -> To see available indicators and frequencies:

            All indicators in documentation. In Oct 2025, frequencies are only Annual.

        Note: You must complete Step 1 before requesting subdata documentation.
